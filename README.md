# Golden Spiral Image Renderer
_"The golden ratio is everywhere, man."_ some high dude might say but it rarely actually is. Rather, humans just imagine it where it is not.
But wouldn't it be funny if we could draw everything using the golden ratio?

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="docs/compressed_gif.gif" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" alt="Example">
</div>

## Features
- Converts any JPEG or PNG image into an artistic rendering using golden spirals.
- Iterative approximation with error measurement.
- Progress tracking and visualization.
- Adjustable parameters for number of spirals and spiral size.
- Convert images of the drawing progress to video.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- NumPy
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Pillow
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

Don't take this too seriously. I made this in the morning before work. â˜•
